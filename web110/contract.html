 <p>I was born in The Democratic Republic of Congo, a large country  in central Africa, i immigrated to United states in 2017, After three months my brother enrolled me at CPCC for the ESL programs, after spending a year in this program, i made a decision to start studying for a career.  In springs semester i started with Music appreciation class, math classes and DRE 97, and then i took a long break for summer.
This semester I'm taking:  DRE 98, Web 110 and Network and Security Foundation 
Something to remember about me:I speak four languages French, English, Lingala and little bit Spanish 
I like to play piano when I have nothing to do.
I also like to ask questions if i don't understand something, I also like share and discuss ideas
